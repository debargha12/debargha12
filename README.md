- Determined the best hyperparameters using **GridSearchCV increasing** the accuracy of emotion detection by **2** %

**Sentiment Analysis of COVID-19 tweets using BigData Technologies**

- Built an end-to-end big data solution for **sentiment analysis** on live tweets using **Python, Kafka, Kibana, Spark**
- Analyzed the combined score of **Vader algorithm** to gauge positivity, negativity and neutrality
- Deployed the **web-based visual dashboard** using **Kibana** to show the **distribution of the sentiments
Search Engine for Cricket using Information Retrieval Techniques**
- Collected data of webpages by scrapping 100,000 web pages using Apache Nutch & Solr to build web graphs
- Implemented **clustering** using **Python** and **Scikit-learn** library improving search results by **15** %
- Deployed the search engine by creating **REST APIs** with **Flask** and collaborated with the design team for testing

**Character Level Name Generation Model using ML Techniques**

- Incorporated gradient clipping and sampled prediction at each step **reducing** the training time by **20** %

**Analysis of Car Evaluation Dataset using ML Techniques**

- Designed an **end-to-end ML pipeline** using **Python** and **Sklearn** library to predict **evaluation of cars**
- Performed **exploratory data analysis** and **feature engineering** to prepare the dataset for modeling
- Determined the best **supervised algorithm** by creating a data pipeline and using RandomSearchCV on alogrithms like
    **SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifier, AdaBoost Classier, Gradient Boosting Classifier**

**AI Searching Techniques**

- Developed Uninformed Search Strategies like **Breadth-first search, Uniform-cost search, Depth-first search,**
    **Depth-limited search, Iterative deepening search** and Informed Search Strategies like **Greedy Best-first**
    **search, A* search and RBFS** using **Python** to find the shortest path from Seattle to Dallas**
